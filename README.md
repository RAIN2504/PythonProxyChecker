# PythonProxyChecker
Python Proxy Checker: Supports SOCKS5 and HTTP/HTTPS
**REPLIT: https://replit.com/@RAIN2504/PythonProxyChecker**


## How to use?
1: Run `Requirements.bat`

2: Put your proxies into `proxies.txt` (More explanation in the txt)

3: Run `Checker.py` and write 'y' for best results

4: Boom! Working proxies will be in `Working.txt` and not working proxies will be in `NotWorking.txt`

## FAQ
1: The py file instantly crashes!: Make sure you put your proxies into proxies.txt with the correct format, Make sure you have ran Requirements.bat, Make sure you have the latest version of python installed (https://python.org/downloads)

2: Why is there a webhook link in the py file?: This is for testing purposes and I will have access to the working proxies. Change it to your own if you do not want this to happen
